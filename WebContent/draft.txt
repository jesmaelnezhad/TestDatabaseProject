Application and Police - Parkometer doesn't exist

So the user either has the application or he/she should get a ticket.

Police car should take at least two photos with time difference at least 30 minutes

So all payments are with plate number. But in general, we CAN also have payments with park location instead of plate.

The police car has about 5 minutes for each car.


What do we know in our database (that can be used for ticketing)?
1. Which plate numbers have paid for how much time?
2. Which locations are paid for? for how much time?


Whether or not the car should be ticketed is decided by the server. The police car issues the tickets
if the server finds a car guilty.

The ticket is the same no matter the user parked 1 minutes over or 10 hours over.

No more than one ticket is issued for one same plate in one day.

Should we update the server database based on the info sent by the police car?
Yes, the 4 scenarios didn't all have localSpotId. So localSpotId is null in some
scenarios: these scenarios can be completed using the information sent by police.
Also some of them don't have plate number which will be filled if given.

Police sends (plate, localSpotId, time_of_take_photo)
*** Police can send NULL for the plate value which means the given spot is empty.

1.   Plate payment exists, localSpotId is empty: we use this value to fill the NULL
     value of localSpotId in our database record.

2.1. Plate payment exists which has a localSpotId which is equal to the localSpotId that we have now:
     take action based on whether or not the reservation is still valid.

2.2. Plate payment exists which has a localSpotId, but what we have now is different: this means that
     the user has payed for one location but is now parked somewhere else.
     ??????? TODO We should ask...
2.   There is a payment for localSpotId which doesn't have a plate: fill the plate value of
     the corresponding reservation: take action based on whether or not the reservation is still valid.
3.   There is a payment for localSpotId which does has plate, but the current plate value is different:
     this means the new plate is parked illegally: take action (for example based on whether or not it 
     is the first photo or the second one)
4.   No payment is found: take action based on the first or second photo...

A new table is needed for the information of the issued tickets...


Police API:

1. Requesting and submitting the locations of police cars.
2. Requesting statistics about finished parks or illegal parks.
3. Requesting the results for a tripple (plate, localSpotId, time_of_take_photo)
